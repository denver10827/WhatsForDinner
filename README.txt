"What's for Dinner?" is an application designed by Denver Phillips to help answer the very question it's named after.

While the app is currently just an idea, the idea is as follows:

1) Users will enter the ingredients that they currently have in their homes
2) Users will state whether or not they are willing to go the store 
	-If yes, user will state how much money they are willing to spend
3) After entering this information, the application will generate a table of foods that they could prepare with the ingredients they have available to them.
4) The user will be able to sort the table by certain variables, including preparation time, calories, average review scores, and possibly more.
